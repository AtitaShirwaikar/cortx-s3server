How to build jcloudclient
- cd auth-utils/jcloudclient.
- mvn clean
- mvn package

Copy the jar file "jcloudclient/target/jcloudclient.jar" to your working directory.

Add the following entries to /etc/hosts.
127.0.0.1    iam.seagate.com
127.0.0.1    sts.seagate.com
127.0.0.1    s3.seagate.com

Option "-a" or "--aws" will run the command on AWS S3. This can be used by
developers to debug issues.
Jcloudclient will search for default properties file "jcloud.properties" in directory which
contains jcloudclient.jar.
If default properties file is absent specify "-c" to configure properties file explicitly.

java -jar jcloudclient.jar -c /root/s3server/st/clitests/jcloudclient.properties

The toolset was developed for testing "bare" libevent throughput.

Server usage:
$ ./server [-port <TCP_port_number>] [-send]

Where:

  * default TCP port is 60001;
  * -send - the server SENDS data to a client and receives otherwise.

./server -port 5001

Note: the binary when built is being linked against local library in source
code tree, but when it runs, it uses library installed in /opt/seagate.

It is possible to override library path:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/your/path/to/libevent ./server -port 5001


Client usage:
$ ./client [-ip <IP_address_of_a_server>] [-port <TCP_port_number>] [-recv]

Where:

  * default IP address is 127.0.0.1
  * default TCP port is 60001
  * -recv - the client receives data from the server (sends by default).


Both programs need "gflags-devel" package to build, and "glfags" package to
run.

The toolset was developed for testing libevent throughput.

Server compilation:
$ g++ -o server --std=c++11 -I <path_to_libevent_include_files> -L <path_to_libevent_libraries> -levent -lgflags server.cpp
Server usage:
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path_to_libevent_libraries> ./server [-port <TCP_port_number>] [-send]
Where:
- default TCP port is 60001;
-send - the server SENDS data to a client and receives otherwise.

Client compilation:
$ g++ -o client --std=c++11 -lgflags client.cpp
Client usage:
$ ./client [-ip <IP_address_of_a_server>] [-port <TCP_port_number>] [-recv]
Where:
- default IP address is 127.0.0.1
- default TCP port is 60001
-recv - the client receives data from the server (sends by default).

Both programs are needed "gflags-devel" package.

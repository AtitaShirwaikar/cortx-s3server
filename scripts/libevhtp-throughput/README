The toolset was designed for testing "bare" throughput of 'libevhtp' library.

The server is listerning on 60080 TCP port.
The client connects to the same port.

To launch server simply run ./server executable.
The server does not have command line arguments, does not detach from console 
and logs messages to console.

The client is needed the packet 'libcurl-devel' for building and 
'curl' packet only for executing.
Client usage: ./client [--put] <server_IP> <size>
Where 'size' is a decimal number with opt. suffix: 'k', 'm' or 'g'.
The client makes HTTP GET request if '--put' argument is ommited.

The client forms URL like http://<server_IP>:60080/<size>
The 'size' instructs the server how much data it should send while GET request.
The 'size' must be decimal number with optional suffix (K, M, G).
  
Examples of using third-party clients:

$ wget -O /dev/null -S --no-http-keep-alive http://<server_IP>:60080/<size>
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/stdout bs=65536 count=32752 | \
curl http://<server_IP>:60080/<arbitrary_term> --upload-file -
